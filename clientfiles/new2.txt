In the realm of software development, the architecture of client-server systems forms the backbone of many applications, allowing distributed and collaborative functionalities.
At its core, client-server architecture involves two distinct entities: the client, which initiates requests, and the server, which processes these requests and delivers responses.
This communication between client and server is facilitated by a fundamental concept known as Inter-process Communication (IPC).
Inter-process Communication (IPC):
IPC refers to the set of mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and share data with each other.
In the context of client-server programming, IPC becomes crucial for enabling seamless communication between the client and server components.
IPC mechanisms can be categorized into various types, including message passing, shared memory, and sockets.
Internet Protocol (IP) Overview:
At the heart of network communication lies the Internet Protocol (IP), a fundamental protocol that governs the addressing and routing of data packets across a network.
IP provides a standardized way for devices to communicate over the Internet, and it forms the basis for higher- level protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
